# Casper-RTL

This is a fork of the default [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). Compatible with Ghost `v0.4.0` and Casper `v0.9.3`.

Adds RTL support to your posts.

Just add `rtl` tag to your post and voilà.

If you are writing in Hebrew and want to spice things up a little with [Alef](http://alef.hagilda.com/) font, just add `hebrew` tag to your post (no need to add both as `hebrew ⊂ rtl`).

## Installation

Just pour contents into `content/themes/casper-rtl` and restart Ghost. Use Ghost settings page to switch to the the rtl theme.
